## Install

Use plugin to inject the js script
If you are using `Tampermonkey`, you can copy/paste all the script in new **empty** file (with the jsdoc block used by tampermonkey for metadata)
With another plugin, the dockblock is not necessary, but you can reuse the youtube pattern in.

## How to use

* Use `Alt + b` to display the integrated mode on the actual watching video
* Close it with clicking on my fabulous Golngaz logo
